# WRITE YOUR EMAIL MESSAGE BELOW THIS LINE
This message has been sent to notify you of your disk quota usage.

Your user account, '--USER--', on --DOMAIN--, has a disk quota limit of --QSIZE--MB. You are currently using --QUSAGEMB--MB (--QUSAGEPC--%) of this quota and have --QAVAIL--MB left.
If your disk quota is filled, you cannot write any more data to the disk and this could result in you being unable to receive email.
You may need to remove some files from your home directory or delete old emails from your webmail account to correct this problem.
Alternatively, you can contact your site administrator and request more disk space.

Thank you,
--COMPANY-- Support
