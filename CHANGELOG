QUOTAWATCH CHANGELOG HISTORY
============================

1.6.1 [7 Febrauary 2005]
- [BUG] Fixed multiple non-fatal bugs in the 'isInLog()' function.
	Warnings were showing up in emails from cron if the alert-logging
	functionality was enabled on server where PHP was set to display
	all notices. Uninitialised variables were being used, resulting
	in the following notices:
	<b>Notice</b>: Undefined variable: fsize in
	<b>/usr/local/sbin/quotawatch</b> on line <b>624</b><br />
	<br />
	<b>Notice</b>: Undefined variable: fsize in
	<b>/usr/local/sbin/quotawatch</b> on line <b>624</b><br />
	<br />
	<b>Notice</b>: Undefined offset: 2 in
	<b>/usr/local/sbin/quotawatch</b> on line <b>633</b><br />
	
==

1.6.0 [17 January 2005]
- Modified the server admin alert email so that it doesn't talk
  about 'trigger values'. Just quotes the percentage of disk quota
  use now.
- [NEW] added the facility to only list the SITES that are over
  quota in the main quotawatch output. This also affects the
  reseller notification email and the server admin email. This
  ensures we are only alerted when a site could have trouble.
- updated the man pages to include information about reseller
  notification and site-only warnings
- [NEW] improved the installation script to ask for the hosting
  company name, if user notification is enabled.

==

1.5.0 [27 October 2004]
- [NEW] reseller notification has been added to quotawatch. This can
  be enabled with the -r switch or --reseller. Resellers receive an
  email in a similar format to the main server administrator.

==

1.4.3 [07 September 2004]
- [BUG] calls to date() function were passing arguments without using
  quotes. Servers with PHP set up to report all notices were generating
  the following output:
  <b>Notice</b>:  Use of undefined constant z - assumed 'z' in <b>/usr/local/sbin/quotawatch</b> on line <b>120</b><br />
  <br />
  <b>Notice</b>:  Use of undefined constant U - assumed 'U' in <b>/usr/local/sbin/quotawatch</b> on line <b>121</b><br />

==


1.4.2 [31 August 2004]
- Moved configuration options for emails out of the quotawatch.conf file
  and into the mail.* files. The custom subjects and mailfrom settings
  can now utilise the mail variables, such as --DOMAIN-- etc.
- New variable --QAVAILPC-- can be used in siteadmin and user emails to
  display the available disk quota as a percentage

==


1.4.1 [20 July 2004]
- [BUG] renaming the tmp alert log file did not work if cross-device
  filesystems were in use
- [BUG] AlertLogPath was always being set to /var/lib/quotawatch, even
  if it was changed in the config file
- [BUG] quota_report calls did not work if /home was on its own partition

  (Thanks to Tino Donderwinkel for finding and helping diagnose all the
  above bugs!)

- [BUG] stopped the constant additions of offenders to the alert log,
  old alerts are removed when a new one for the same offender is added,
  as should have always been the case!

==


1.4.0 [14 July 2004] - NEVER LEFT BETA STAGE - superceded by 1.4.1
- [BUG] Fixed a bug that lead to notices being generated if E_NOTICES
  were set to be displayed in /etc/php.ini
- [NEW] Installation script now asks if you would like to read the GPL,
  as interactive programs are supposed to
- [NEW] Installation script keeps original configuration files in place,
  so as not to overwrite customisations to emails
- [BUG] Fixed incorrect calls to displayWarning funciton
- [NEW] Created man pages for section 8 and section 5
- [NEW] Added alert-logging functionality (-l or --log switches). This
  stops quotawatch from alarming every hour if an over-trigger quota is
  not dealt with
- added more resilience to setting of config options

==

1.3.1 [23 June 2004]
- [BUG] the main server admin email was warning that users/sites were
  'close to or over' the trigger value. They won't ever be 'close to' the
  trigger value (wording that goes back to versions that didn't quote the
  trigger value in the email) they will be 'at or over' the trigger.

==

1.3.0 [13 June 2004]
- [NEW] added functionality to use --notify option to notify users and
  site admins of quota alerts
- [NEW] created quotawatch.conf file to house various details for use in
  notification emails to users/site admins
- [NEW] provided two mail template files to enable server admin to control
  notification mail content
- [BUG] fixed bug where group id's were sometimes incorrect, resulting in
  duplicate (incorrect) results being displayed for domains
- updated the installquotawatch script to deal with new notification
  functionality

==

1.2.4 [10 June 2004]
- changed the install path to /usr/local/sbin
- [BUG] updated the install script to chmod 700 the quotawatch file
- some formatting improvements to the install script output
- changed the output of quotawatch to specify the trigger value that was
  used

==

1.2.3 [13 May 2004]
- [BUG] installation script was creating a cron script that referenced the wrong
  path to quotawatch

==

1.2.2 [05 May 2004]
- improved the installquotawatch script, so that it asks for values to put
  into the quotawatch.cron script (if it is needed)

==

1.2.1
- added full command paths to exec() commands

==

1.2.0
- [NEW] added the disk usage in MB to the report
- added CHANGELOG file, amended install script to rm changelog after
  installation

==

1.1.0
- [NEW] added the --version, -v functionality

==

1.0.1
- general code tidying
- [BUG] changed the type-setting of the quota from 'integer' to 'float'. Checking
  for triggers was not accurate enough when using an int. For example, setting
  trigger to 2% would not flag a warning for a site at 2.99%, because integer
  conversion just removed the .99

==

1.0
- initial release
