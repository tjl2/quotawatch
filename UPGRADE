QUOTAWATCH UPGRADE NOTES
========================
Note: the steps outlined in this file are only applicable
if you are upgrading quotawatch. New installations do not
require these steps.

Quotawatch 1.4.2 and upwards now takes custom email subjects
and mail-from settings from each mail.siteadmin or mail.user
file.

Quotawatch 1.5.0 and upwards now has a reseller notification
ability. This is enabled by using the -r or --reseller switch
on your quotawatch command. You will need to modify your
/etc/cron.hourly/quotawatch.cron script to include this switch
if you want to turn this feature on.

Quotawatch 1.6.0 and upwards now has a site-only warning switch.
This is enabled by using the -s or --site-only switch on your
quotawatch command. You will need to modify your
/etc/cron.hourly/quotawatch.cron script to include this switch
if you want to turn this feature on.

The following settings in quotawatch.conf are now no
longer used:
MailFrom
NotificationSubject

Instead, these should be set in both mail.siteadmin and
mail.user.
If you have not customised the email bodies in these files,
you can safely rename mail.user.1.4.2 and mail.siteadmin.1.4.2
to mail.user and mail.siteadmin, respectively.
Alternatively, if you have changed the contents of these files,
just add the following lines at the top of the file to change
the subject and mailfrom settings from default values:

--SUBJECT = Your Modified Subject
--MAILFROM = Your Modified Email <you@yours.com>

You can now use the mail variables in these settings, for added
flexibility (e.g.: you could set your MAILFROM to use the
--COMPANY-- variable)

If these lines are not present in the mail files, or present,
but not set, then quotawatch will use defaults.

You can also overwrite your quotawatch.conf file with the
quotawatch.conf.1.x.x file and just amend the CompanyName if you
wish.

QUOTAWATCH WILL STILL RUN, WITHOUT ERROR, EVEN IF YOU MAKE NONE OF
THESE CHANGES.
