QUOTAWATCH README
=================
The quotawatch script was written to enable one user to be made aware of
disk quota usage on an Ensim server. For some reason, this functionality is
not included in Ensim.

Using the same Ensim scripts that are used to display usage info in the
various control panel screens, quotawatch recursively checks the disk quota
of each site and each site's users on the server and displays any quotas that
are over a specified trigger value (a default of 90% can be used). As well
as displaying results on screen, quotawatch can send the results via email to
a specified address.

Quotawatch can also be told to notify any resellers, users and site administrators
if they, or their site, are over the trigger value. The emails that are sent to
users and site administrators are customisable, and can be changed by editing the
mail.user and mail.siteadmin files in /etc/quotawatch/.

INSTALLATION
============
To install or upgrade quotawatch, simply run the installquotawatch script as root.
The install script will then ask you if you wish to set up an hourly cron job to
automatically run quotawatch. If you answer yes, you will then be asked the following
questions:
1) Quotawatch triggers an alert when disk usage is at or over 90% of quota by default.
   Would you like to specify a different (custom) value to trigger alerts?
2) Quotawatch can notify users and site administrators when they have triggered
   a disk quota alert.
   Do you want to enable user notification in your hourly quotawatch run?
3) Quotawatch can notify resellers when any of their associated sites or users trigger
   an alert.
   Do you want to enable reseller notification in your hourly quotawatch run?
   Please enter your hosting company name (to be displayed on notification emails)
4) You can enable logging in your cron script to stop alerts being sent more than
   once per day for each over-quota account. Without this option, you will be
   notified every hour for an over-quota alert that remains unfixed.
   Do you wish to enable alert-logging in your hourly quotawatch run?
5) You can set quotawatch to only tell you about site quota alerts, not user quota
   alerts, as these are more important for server administrators.
   Do you wish to ignore user quota alerts?
6) You can provide one or more email addresses for quotawatch to send alert results
   to.
   If you are providing more than one email address, separate each one with a comma.

If you answer no to the cron job question, quotawatch will be installed, but without
the script being added that will enable automatic hourly execution.

UPGRADING
=========
If you are upgrading quotawatch from a previous version, just run the installation
script as usual. It will not overwrite your /etc/quotawatch/mail.* files, but create
new ones with a '.version' extension, where 'version' is the current version number.
If an existing quotawatch.cron file is found, you will not be asked the installation
questions. Depending on the new version of quotawatch, your quotawatch.conf file may
need to be overwritten or manually edited. You will be told if this is the case.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
[1] quotawatch can be passed multiple email addresses to send results
    to. Each address needs to be separated by A COMMA AND ONLY A COMMA (no spaces).
    The installation script doesn't do any validation of the provided emails other
    than looking for an '@' sign; so you could quite easily create an invalid email
    string.

[2] be careful when specifying custom trigger values when using user
    notification! If you were to use a trigger of 0% quota usage and pass the
    --notify or -n option, you would email ALL users on the server warning them
    that they are using over 0% of their disk quota! Be especially careful that
    such a set up does not end up in your /etc/cron.hourly/quotawatch.cron file;
    within a few hours, if you are not using the --log option, you will have
    irritated the majority of your customers!
    You should always keep the quotawatch.cron trigger value fairly high (at least
    80%) to avoid sending unnecessary warnings. You have been warned.

The installation script will add the quotawatch script to /usr/local/sbin and
will add configuration files and mail templates to /etc/quotawatch. It will
also add a cron job as /etc/cron.hourly/quotawatch.cron if you answer yes to
the first question.

For more information on using quotawatch after installation, simply run:
  quotawatch --help
or
  quotawatch -h
or...
There are now man pages for quotawatch in man sections 8 and 5. Use 'man quotawatch'
for detailed information about quotawatch. Use 'man 5 quotawatch' for info regarding
quotawatch's associated config and email files.

CHANGELOG SUMMARY

1.6.0 [17 January 2005]
- Modified the server admin alert email so that it doesn't talk
  about 'trigger values'. Just quotes the percentage of disk quota
  use now.
- [NEW] added the facility to only list the SITES that are over
  quota in the main quotawatch output. This also affects the
  reseller notification email and the server admin email. This
  ensures we are only alerted when a site could have trouble.
- updated the man pages to include information about reseller
  notification and site-only warnings
- [NEW] improved the installation script to ask for the hosting
  company name, if user notification is enabled.
